# Rust bindings for the ArcGIS CityEngine SDK

main branch status: ![cargo test status](https://github.com/mistafunk/prust/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Not much to see here (yet?). Basically, I am using the CityEngine SDK to learn Rust ;-)

Feel free to ping me if you want to help or collaborate!

Disclaimer: this is a personal project I'm working on in my spare time. It is not connected to any product roadmap of Esri.
